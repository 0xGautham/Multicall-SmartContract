## MULTICALL SMART CONTRACT 

Multi Call is a design pattern that allows us to batch multiple contract calls into a single transaction, significantly reducing gas costs and enhancing the overall efficiency of our dApps. By aggregating multiple calls, we minimize the overhead associated with executing each call separately, and thus, users can save valuable funds when using our smart contracts.


## How does Multi Call work?

To implement Multi Call, we use a smart contract acting as a proxy that aggregates and dispatches multiple read-only function calls to other contracts. These read-only functions donâ€™t modify the blockchain state; therefore, they do not require a separate transaction.

The Multi Call contract gathers all the required function signatures and parameters, then executes them together as a single transaction, processing all the calls in one go. This not only saves gas costs but also reduces the number of interactions with the blockchain, which is beneficial for scalability.

## Benefits of Multi Call

1. Gas Cost Reduction: By aggregating calls into a single transaction, users can save significant amounts of gas, especially when dealing with a large number of contract calls.

2. Improved Efficiency: Multi Call minimizes the number of interactions with the blockchain, leading to better scalability and faster response times for dApps.

3. Enhanced User Experience: Lower gas costs mean users are more likely to interact with your dApp, resulting in a better overall user experience.

4. Simplified Code: Implementing Multi Call can simplify the codebase, as it reduces the need for multiple function calls.

5. Economic Scalability: With reduced gas fees, your dApp becomes more economically scalable, attracting more users and transactions.
